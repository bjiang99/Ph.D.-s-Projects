# Dynamic Graph Learning
A MATLAB implementation of dynamic graph learning based on ICASSP 2021 paper [Dynamic graph learning based on graph laplacian](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9413744).
A MATLAB implementation of dynamic graph learning with higher-order information based on Mathematics jounal paper [Dynamic graph learning: a structure-driven approach](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/9/2/168).


## Requirements
- [MATLAB]

### Dataset
We collaborated with another group, Dr. Smith's neuroscience group, in UCSB.
The data is recorded real-world signals of mouse's neurons. The technic is based on flourescent tracking among large amount of neurons (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5244827/). This dataset is not available to public.
We still build a synthetic data, which has a similar statistical parameters to the neuronal network, please send an email to bjiang8@ncsu.edu if needed.
